The goal of this project is create a program which simulates the interactions between oragnisms
within a system.

The project will use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) brain on each of the agents in the system.

TODO:
- Have agents hunt for food
- Interaction between agents (killing, avoidance, and general awareness)
- reproduction of agents through: asexual means & randomized mating.
- Herbivore and carnivore agents
