# OrganismSim
Implements an organism evolution simulation using a MLP neural network in C++

Neural Network

The current Neural Network of the agents is implemented as follows, this is subject to change:

1) Inputs:

  a.3 Smell inputs, intensity (based on size of food) and normalized X Y coordinates.
  
  b.1 Hunger input that is proportional to the Agent's fullness factor.
  
2) 1 Hidden Layer made up of 8 neurons.
  
3) Ouputs:

  a. Right Wheel intensity
  
  b. Left Wheel intensity
